    <h1>WEB3.......THE NEW NORMAL</h1>
    <div class="image"><img src="pictures/WEB 3.jpg" /></div>
    <p>
      Web2 is the internet we know and love today, dominated by the Big Tech
      companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. But, there is a
      new version on the rise that wants to put the power back in the hands of
      everyday people. Web 3.0, better known as Web3, is what society is dubbing
      the next iteration of the World Wide Web, with a dash of cryptocurrency.
      Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood coined the term Web3 in 2014 as he started
      investing more in creating decentralized technologies. He settled on the
      term Web3 after considering the versions of the internet that came before
      it.In the early 90s, non-interactive links and homepages arrived on the
      internet, mainly accessible via dial-up. This was Web 1.0 and the era of
      static web pages. Web2 was born amid the dotcom bubble in the new
      millennium, and is characterized by the ability for the user to create and
      share information. We’ve been using this version of the web for more than
      two decades, enabling developers to create computer code that lets you
      open and edit digital files instead of just viewing them. We’ve seen
      plenty of Web2 rebrands, but the technology and cryptocurrency industries
      are ready for a more considerable change that allows people to read,
      write, and own their versions of the internet. Enter Web3. In a way, Web3
      is a blend of its predecessors: a decentralized internet before Big Tech
      took over, mixed with the advanced applications of the modern web.
      Decentralized, in this context, simply means that no one entity controls
      how users experience the internet. It’s the World Wide Web in its most
      basic, ideal form — unregulated, peer-to-peer communication that does not
      require or include an intermediary. Those intermediaries, detailed below,
      can do everything from censor content to use algorithms to regulate which
      users see which pieces of content.

      <h3>HOW DOES WEB3 ALIGN WITH BLOCKCHAIN</h3>
      <p>
        Web3 will be a portfolio of decentralized apps that run on blockchains,
        Ethereum reports, and it will grant anyone permission to use the
        network’s services. The idea of Web3 gained the most traction this year
        after significant growth in cryptocurrencies. Right now, our
        participation on the internet is controlled by central authorities.
        You’re able to Google topics because the site’s parent company,
        Alphabet, allows you. You’re able to post photos on Instagram because
        Meta said you could. While Twitter has loosened up its restrictions on
        what you can post, it still controls who can hold accounts and tweet.
        Remember when the platform banned former President Donald Trump? The
        mission behind Web3 is to create a decentralized web that permits sites
        and services to exist across any and all computer networks. Blockchain
        technology will validate user data, and you’ll have to purchase
        everything in Web3 with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain tech and digital
        tokens will power Web3, so if you’re still not familiar with
        cryptocurrencies, it might be time to get with the movement.
